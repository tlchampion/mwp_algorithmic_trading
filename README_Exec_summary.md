# Executive Summary
The team used data collection, trading signals creation, backtesting, and machine learning to develop a new algorithmic trading strategy. They collected historical data using the Yahoo Finance API and created indicators with Python-TA library. Trading models were developed based on specific buy/sell signals, and performance was tested against a market benchmark. The best-performing algorithm was selected for each portfolio class to be displayed on the MyWealthPath platform. The platform is designed to help users determine their risk tolerance and provide them with information on one of five preselected portfolios that align with their risk tolerance. The tool is written in Python and uses various libraries, such as Panel, Bokeh, hvPlot, and Matplotlib. The programms contributors are Ahmad Takatkah, Lourdes Dominguez Begoa, Patricio Gomez, Lovedeep Singh, and Thomas L. Champion.
